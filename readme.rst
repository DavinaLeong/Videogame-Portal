Here is my first ever CodeIgniter application.
This application was built in Nov 2015 and was originally hosted on BitBucket.

The sole intent and purpose of this project was to sharpen my skills in web development.
While I have been actively developing various types of software, most of the environments then be isolated environments; a C++ application will always be a C++ application; C#--C# app; etc.

The biggest challenge I faced during web development was seeing how all the different technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) come together to make a website. So I made this project to help me achieve that.
